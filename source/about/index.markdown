I work as a security analyst in Upstate New York.  The Sean In A Box term stems from my office.  I essentially work in a room with no
windows, which I refer to as "The Box".  While in there I dabble in all things Tech related.  I'm not an expert on any of the subject 
matter in my postings, I'm just using this blog as sort of a journal / documenting tool.  If people find use from it, great.  If you don't,
then oh-well.  I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.  However, if you do find something I post to be incorrect, or if you know of a better
way to accomplish the same goal then please let me know! I'm in this to learn as much as possible and grow myself so I can reach my goals.

My other interests include drumming, grilling, and gaming, so you might see some completely un-realated things from time to time :-)
